In this project, we are going to create an end-to-end data platform covering Data Ingestion, Data Transformation, Data Loading, and Reporting. 

## Tools Covered
1. Azure Data Factory
2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
3. Azure Databricks
4. Azure Synapse Analytics
5. Azure Key Vault
6. Azure Active Directory (AAD)
7. Microsoft Power BI

## Use Case
The use case for this project involves building an end-to-end solution by ingesting tables from an on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory and storing the data in Azure Data Lake. Azure Databricks is used to transform the raw data into its cleanest form. We then use Azure Synapse Analytics to load the clean data and finally use Microsoft Power BI to integrate with Azure Synapse Analytics to build an interactive dashboard. Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault are used for monitoring and governance purposes.

## Agenda
- **Part 1:** Environment setup
- **Part 2:** Data Ingestion
